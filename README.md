# CORE INTRO TO GIT AND GITHUB

Slides and materials are hosted at [http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-core-git-github/](http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-core-git-github/).

## Course description

This is the official Girl Develop It Core Intro to Git and Github course. Material based on original material by Kim Moir, Daniel Fischer, Aurelia Moser, Carina C. Zona and Izzy Johnston.

The course is meant to be taught in a two-hour workshop. Each of the slides and practice files are customizable according to the needs of a given class or audience.

### About this class

Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how it was working before? Want to work together with someone on a code project, but aren't sure who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve these and many other problems!

Version control is an essential skill for any web or software developer to manage their code base, keep track of changes, and coordinate major revisions with other team members. Git is the fastest growing and most popular open source version control system used today. It's useful whether you are working on a large distributed team or working on smaller personal projects.

### Course overview

The session will be 2.5 hours long and will be broken up into two sections:

Section 1 (one hour):
• Basic concepts of version control
• Basics of the command line interface

Section 2 (one hour):
• Introduction to Git & Git commands.
• Setting up your Github account - Creating your first Repo

### Prerequisites:

Prior coding experience is not necessary in order to take this class, just a willingness to learn something new!

This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language. We will be learning how to change directories, list directory contents, and learning how to use git from command line throughout the class.

### Tech requirements:

 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A text editor. We recommend [https://www.sublimetext.com/](Sublime Text) (It's free and available for both Mac and PC). Please install prior to the first class.

### Topics covered:

 - Installing and setting up Git
 - Basics of version control
 - How to use Git to keep track of your changes to a project
 - Using [https://github.com/](GitHub) (a social code hosting service) to collaborate with other developers.
